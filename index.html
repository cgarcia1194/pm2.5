			<p class="intro">   In Brooklyn, levels of PM2.5, the most harmful air pollutant, are higher in neighborhoods along the Brooklyn-Queens-Expressway. 
			</p>  

			<p>NYC.gov released <a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-explorer/air-quality/?id=2023#display=map" target="blank">data</a> for annual average measurements of PM2.5 for the entire city in 2022. The data reveals that residents in Brooklyn who are closer to the BQE suffer from higher exposure to the pollutant.

            <p> PM2.5, or fine particulate matter, is a term for tiny particles that pollute the air. They are <a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/key-topics/airquality/realtime/#" target="_blank">caused</a> by everyday urban activities like traffic density, truck density, and diesel exhaust in industrial areas. 
			</p>

			<p> According to the NYC Department of Health, PM2.5 from traffic causes an estimated 320 premature <a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-stories/traffic-and-air-pollution/" target="_blank">deaths</a> per year. 
			</p>

			<p> “The people who live directly under the BQE are predominantly Black and Brown and predominantly lower-income,” says Rose Uscianowski, an organizer at Transportation Alternatives. “They have been harmed for decades because of this structure that the city and state created.” </p>
